**Ceelo Game Rules:**

1. two or more players

2. To determine the bank, all players roll a die, and the player with the highest roll becomes the bank. In the case of ties, re-roll.

3. The bank chooses the amount they want to bet, which can range from $1 to their available funds.

4. After the bank's bet is chosen, players 2, 3, and 4 have the option to place their bets based on the available bank funds. Player 2 can bet the entire amount or a smaller amount. If Player 2 bets a smaller amount, players 3 and 4 can continue to bet in turn until the bank has no betting power.

5. The bank rolls three dice. If two dice match, the third value becomes the bank's point for that round.

6. Winning conditions for the bank:
   - If the bank rolls 1-2-3, the bank loses all bets.
   - If the bank rolls 4-5-6, the bank wins the bets.
   - If the bank rolls three dice with the same value, the bank wins.

7. If the bank loses all its money, the bank role goes to the player who took the last turn.

8. To reset the game for a new round, re-determine the bank and redistribute money if necessary.
